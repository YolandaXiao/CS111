lab1a.c:
	This is the code for project lab1a. The first part of the program deals with non-canonical output. The program outputs keyboard input one at a time. The second part of the program involves forking process and multi-threading. When given the argument --shell, the program can output shell command results. 

Makefile:
	Builds lab1a, clean the directory, and makes the tarball.


Testing methodology

	For the first part, we type characters in and see if they are displayed one at a time accordingly. We also test by control-d and control-c to see if the program exits correctly.
	For the second part, we tested it by inputting shell commands like "ls" and "pwd" and see if the output is as expected. We also test it typing control-c and control-d to see if it exits with the correct signal number.
