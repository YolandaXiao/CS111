client.c
It creates a socket to send and receive message from the server. It has three options: --port, --log, and --encrypt. The port option specifies the port number, the log one records communications, and the encrypt one encrypts messages.

server.c
The code for the server part interpretes the message sent from the socket. It runs the command, and return the result to the client one. It has two options: --port and --encrypt, which are similar to that in the client code.

my.key
Includes the key to encrypt and decrypt for the client and the server

Makefile
Builds the executables for lab1b, clean the directory and builds a tarball

testing methodology
Typed in three different options for client and for two different options for server. For example, when opening server, and typing in ls command in client, we receive the list of files we had in the directory. It thus means the server received the message and responded back. We tested the encryption option accordingly and it works.
