3.Breakpoint.png
	The screenshot shows the details of where the segmentation fault happens.
	
4.Backtrace.png
	The screenshot shows the details of the pointer by using the commands backtrace and backtrace full. 

5.Testing methodology
	  1)The cases when output and input files differs, exit status 0 recieves.
	  2)The case when input file doesnt exist, exit status is 1.
	  3)The case when output file is not writable, exit status is 2.
	  4)The case when segmentation fault happens. Extract the 'Segmentation fault' message and compare it to test.
	  5)The case when segmentation fault happens and the handler catches it. Check exit status and the output messsage if it's the same as expected.
